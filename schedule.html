                  <h2>Our Event</h2>
                  <h3>We're getting married!</h3>
                  <p>Hello! We're excited that you're here and hope that you can join us for our celebration in just a few months!<br><br>
                  Please join us on October 11th, 2025 for our special day at the cute and cozy Lala's Apizza in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
                  <h3>Our house party away from home</h3>
                  <p>When thinking about the type of event that we wanted for our special day, we felt it was important to host something that felt intimate and cozy, had great atmosphere and food, and would allow us to spend time with all of you. We've dubbed the feeling our "elevated house party"!<br><br>
                  We've had so many wonderful times at Lala's and Grimm Artisinal Ales over the last 7 years that we've lived in NYC. It's one of our favorite places here and we're so glad that we can share it, and a small piece of our home, with all of you. Let's have some pizza, beer, and dance the night away!
                  <br><br>
                  We know it's all a little non-traditional, but we're really glad that this is something that feels like us and the lives we live every day.</p>

                  <h3>The full schedule and details</h3>
                  <p>Our party will be from 6:00 - 10:00pm on October 11th, 2025.<br><br>
                    Lala's is located at: 990 Metropolitan Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211<br><br>
                  We will have a short ceremony at 6:30 hosted by our favorite little brother, and person who introduced us, John Supnik.<br><br>
                  Afterward, there will be appetizers, pizza, salads, and more food coming out all night.<br><br>
                  Lala's is a half indoor / half outdoor space. If there is inclement weather, we will be moving the entire party downstairs into the main room of Grimm Artisinal Ales.<br><br>
                  Because this is a brewery, we will not be able to invite children to this party.<br><br>
                  Please note that because this is on the rooftop of a building that there are two flights of stairs up to the venue. Please let us know if that is of any concern!
                  </p>
                  <h3>Dress code</h3>
                  <p>Because Lala's is an indoor/outdoor space, please make sure you dress accordingly. As noted above, if there is inclement weather, we will be moving fully indoors.<br><br>
                    We would like attire to be formal but that rule isn't so strict. Feel free to have fun with it if there's something a outside of that box. Please just no jeans!
                  </p>
                  <h3>What else?</h3>
                  <p>We're sure we haven't thought of all of the potential questions that you might have, so if there's anything you are unsure about regarding our event or navigating New York, please don't hesitate to reach out to either of us. You have our info!<br><br>
